# Contributions:
+ Wrote all of the update() logic for robots (clean, move, etc.)
+ Wrote logic for errors (new constructor, random number generation, variable error rate for different robots)
+ Rewrote constructors for Robot and SimulationDriver to handle the Map& reference in Robot (avoid default constructing Robot)
+ Wrote unit tests for all of the above (cleaning_tests.cpp) and updated CMakeLists.txt accordingly
+ Updated class diagram to reflect changes in Robot and S.D. constructors
+ Formatted & wrote unit testing section of user guide
